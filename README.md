# C_Matrix

## A very basic matrix math shell written to practice C and linear algebra.

Matrices are viewed as an array of vectors rather than rows of arrays. 

My thinking is that this will simplify multiplication even though it will
complicate population of matrices from user input.

Currently Matrices aren't functional yet. Vectors are working. Adding and multiplying operate on the last two Vectors in the array.
